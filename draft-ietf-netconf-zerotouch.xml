        <abstract>
            <t>This draft presents a technique to securely provision a networking
            device when it is booting in a factory-default state.  Variations
            in the solution enables it to be used on both public and private
            networks.  The provisioning steps are able to update the boot image,
            commit an initial configuration, and execute arbitrary scripts to
            address auxiliary needs.  The updated device is subsequently able
            to establish secure connections with other systems.  For instance,
            a device may establish NETCONF (RFC 6241) and/or RESTCONF (RFC 8040)
            connections with deployment-specific network management systems.</t>

      <section title="Introduction">

        <t>A fundamental business requirement for any network operator is
        to reduce costs where possible.  For network operators, deploying
        devices to many locations can be a significant cost, as sending
        trained specialists to each site for installations is both cost
        prohibitive and does not scale.</t>

        <t>This document defines Secure Zero Touch Provisioning (SZTP),
        a bootstrapping strategy enabling devices to securely obtain
        bootstrapping data with no installer action beyond physical
        placement and connecting network and power cables.  As such,
        SZTP enables non-technical personnel to bring up devices in
        remote locations without the need for any operator input.</t>

        <t>The SZTP solution includes updating the boot image,
        committing an initial configuration, and executing arbitrary scripts to
        address auxiliary needs.  The updated device is subsequently able to
        establish secure connections with other systems.  For instance, a
        devices may establish NETCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/> and/or RESTCONF
        <xref target="RFC6241"/> connections with deployment-specific network
        management systems.</t>

        <t>This document primarily regards physical devices, where the setting
        of the device's initial state, described in <xref target="initial-state"/>,
        occurs during the device's manufacturing process.  The SZTP solution
        may be extended to support virtual machines or other such logical
        constructs, but details for how this can be accomplished is left
        for future work.</t>

                  ISP's network to provide any bootstrapping support, and with no other
                  nearby device to leverage, the device has no recourse but to reach

              <t hangText="Manufacturer:">The term "manufacturer" is used herein to
              refer to the manufacturer of a device or a delegate of the manufacturer.</t>

              <t hangText="Network Management System (NMS):">The acronym "NMS" is used
              throughout this document to refer to the deployment-specific management
              system that the bootstrapping process is responsible for introducing devices to.
              From a device's perspective, when the bootstrapping process has completed,
              the NMS is a NETCONF or RESTCONF client.</t>

              <t hangText="Onboarding Information:">The term "onboarding information" is used
              herein to refer to one of the two types of "conveyed information"
              defined in this document, the other being "redirect information".  Onboarding
              information is formally defined by the "onboarding-information" YANG-data

              a device.</t>

              <t hangText="Owner Certificate:">The term "owner certificate" is used in
              this document to represent an X.509 certificate that binds an owner identity
              to a public key, which a device can use to validate a signature over the
              conveyed information artifact.  The owner certificate may be communicated
              along with its chain of intermediate certificates leading up to a known
              trust anchor.  The owner certificate is one of the three bootstrapping
              artifacts described in <xref target="artifacts"/>.</t>

              <t hangText="Ownership Voucher:">The term "ownership voucher" is used in
              this document to represent the voucher artifact defined in <xref
              target="RFC8366"/>.  The ownership voucher is used to
              assign a device to an owner.  The ownership voucher is one of

              to a bootstrap server that only returns redirect information.  A redirect
              server is particularly useful when hosted by a manufacturer, as a
              well-known (e.g., Internet-based) resource to redirect devices to
              deployment-specific bootstrap servers.</t>

              <t hangText="Signed Data:">The term "signed data" is used throughout to mean
              conveyed information that has been signed, specifically by a private key

      <section title="Types of Conveyed Information" anchor="types-of-information">

        <t>This document defines two types of conveyed information that devices can access during
        the bootstrapping process.  These conveyed information types are described in
        this section. Examples are provided in <xref target="zt-info-data-model-examples"/></t>

        <section title="Redirect Information" anchor="redirect-information">
          <t>Redirect information redirects a device to
          another bootstrap server.  Redirect information encodes a list of bootstrap
          servers, each specifying the bootstrap server's hostname (or IP address),
          an optional port, and an optional trust anchor certificate that the device
          can use to authenticate the bootstrap server with.</t>

          <t>Redirect information is YANG modeled data formally defined by the
          "redirect-information" container in the YANG module presented in
          <xref target="info-yang-module"/>.  This container has the tree
          diagram shown below.</t>
          <t><figure>
            <artwork name="redirect-information-tree.txt"><![CDATA[
INSERT_TEXT_FROM_FILE(refs/redirect-information-tree.txt)
]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

          <t>Redirect information may be trusted or untrusted.  The redirect information
          is trusted whenever it is obtained via a secure connection to a trusted bootstrap
          server, or whenever it is signed by the device's owner.  In all other
          cases, the redirect information is untrusted.</t>

          <t>Trusted redirect information is useful for enabling a device to establish
          a secure connection to a specified bootstrap server, which is possible when the redirect
          information includes the bootstrap server's trust anchor certificate.</t>

          <t>Untrusted redirect information is useful for directing a device to a bootstrap
          server where signed data has been staged for it to obtain.  Note that, when the
          redirect information is untrusted, devices discard any potentially included trust
          anchor certificates.</t>

          <t>How devices process redirect information is described in
          <xref target="process-redirect-information"/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Onboarding Information" anchor="onboarding-information">

          <t>Onboarding information provides data necessary for a device
          to bootstrap itself and establish secure connections with other
          systems.  As defined in this document, onboarding information can
          specify details about the boot image a device must be running, 
          specify an initial configuration the device must commit, and 
          specify scripts that the device must successfully execute.</t>

          <t>Onboarding information is YANG modeled data formally defined by the
          "onboarding-information" container in the YANG module presented in
          <xref target="info-yang-module"/>.  This container has the tree diagram
          shown below.</t>

INSERT_TEXT_FROM_FILE(refs/onboarding-information-tree.txt)
]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

          <t>Onboarding information must be trusted for it to be of any use to a device.
          There is no option for a device to process untrusted onboarding information.</t>

          <t>Onboarding information is trusted whenever it is obtained via a secure connection
          to a trusted bootstrap server, or whenever it is signed by the device's
          owner.  In all other cases, the onboarding information is untrusted.</t>

      <section title="Artifacts" anchor="artifacts">

        <t>This document defines three artifacts that can be made available
        to devices while they are bootstrapping.  Each source of bootstrapping
        data specifies how it provides the artifacts defined in this section
        (see <xref target="sources"/>).</t>

        <section title="Conveyed Information" anchor="conveyed-information">
          <t>The conveyed information artifact encodes the essential bootstrapping
          data for the device.  This artifact is used to encode the redirect
          information and onboarding information types discussed in <xref
          target="types-of-information"/>.</t>

          <t>The conveyed information artifact is a CMS structure, as described
          in <xref target="RFC5652"/>, encoded using ASN.1 distinguished encoding
          rules (DER), as specified in ITU-T X.690 <xref target="ITU.X690.2015"/>.
          The CMS structure MUST contain content conforming to the
          YANG module specified in <xref target="info-yang-module"/>.</t>

          <t>The conveyed information CMS structure may encode signed or
          unsigned bootstrapping data.  When the bootstrapping data is signed,
          it may also be encrypted but, from a terminology perspective, it
          is still "signed data" <xref target="terminology"/>.</t>

          <t>When the conveyed information artifact is unsigned, as it might
          be when communicated over trusted channels, the CMS structure's 
          top-most content type MUST be one of the OIDs described in 
          <xref target="cms_cts"/> (i.e., id-ct-sztpConveyedInfoXML or
          id-ct-sztpConveyedInfoJSON), or the OID id-data (1.2.840.113549.1.7.1).
          When the OID id-data is used, the encoding (JSON, XML, etc.)
          SHOULD be communicated externally. In either case, the associated
          content is an octet string containing "conveyed-information"
          data in the expected encoding.</t>

          <t>When the conveyed information artifact is unsigned and 
          encrypted, as it might be when communicated over trusted
          channels but, for some reason, the operator wants to ensure
          that only the device is able to see the contents, the CMS 
          structure's top-most content type MUST be the OID id-envelopedData
          (1.2.840.113549.1.7.3). Furthermore, the encryptedContentInfo's
          content type MUST be one of the OIDs described in 
          <xref target="cms_cts"/> (i.e., id-ct-sztpConveyedInfoXML
          or id-ct-sztpConveyedInfoJSON), or the OID id-data
          (1.2.840.113549.1.7.1).  When the OID id-data is used,
          the encoding (JSON, XML, etc.) SHOULD be communicated
          externally. In either case, the associated content is
          an octet string containing "conveyed-information" data
          in the expected encoding.</t>

          <t>When the conveyed information artifact is signed, as it might
          be when communicated over untrusted channels, the CMS structure's
          top-most content type MUST be the OID id-signedData (1.2.840.113549.1.7.2).
          Furthermore, the inner eContentType MUST be one of the OIDs described in
          <xref target="cms_cts"/> (i.e., id-ct-sztpConveyedInfoXML or 
          id-ct-sztpConveyedInfoJSON), or the OID id-data (1.2.840.113549.1.7.1).
          When the OID id-data is used, the encoding (JSON, XML, etc.) SHOULD
          be communicated externally.  In either case, the associated content
          or eContent is an octet string containing "conveyed-information"
          data in the expected encoding.</t>

          <t>When the conveyed information artifact is signed and encrypted,
          as it might be when communicated over untrusted channels and 
          privacy is important, the CMS structure's top-most content type
          MUST be the OID id-envelopedData (1.2.840.113549.1.7.3). Furthermore,

        <section title="Owner Certificate" anchor="owner-certificate">
          <t>The owner certificate artifact is an X.509 certificate
          <xref target="RFC5280"/> that is used to identify an "owner" (e.g.,
          an organization).  The owner certificate can be signed by any
          certificate authority (CA).  The owner certificate either MUST have
          no Key Usage specified or the Key Usage MUST at least set the
          "digitalSignature" bit.  The values for the owner certificate's
          "subject" and/or "subjectAltName" are not constrained by this
          document.</t>

          <t>The owner certificate is used by a device to verify the signature over
          the conveyed information artifact (<xref target="conveyed-information"/>)
          that the device should have also received, as described in
          <xref target="artifact-groupings"/>.  In particular, the device
          verifies the signature using the public key in the owner certificate
          over the content contained within the conveyed information artifact.</t>

          <t>The owner certificate artifact is formally a CMS structure, as
          specified by <xref target="RFC5652"/>, encoded using ASN.1
          distinguished encoding rules (DER), as specified in ITU-T X.690
          <xref target="ITU.X690.2015"/>.</t>

          <t>The owner certificate CMS structure MUST contain the owner
          certificate itself, as well as all intermediate certificates leading
          to the "pinned-domain-cert" certificate specified in the ownership
          voucher.  The owner certificate artifact MAY optionally include the
          "pinned-domain-cert" as well.</t>

          <t>In order to support devices deployed on private networks,
          the owner certificate CMS structure MAY also contain suitably fresh,
          as determined by local policy, revocation objects (e.g., CRLs).
          Having these revocation objects stapled to the owner certificate may
          obviate the need for the device to have to download them dynamically
          using the CRL distribution point or an OCSP responder specified in
          the associated certificates.</t>

          <t>When unencrypted, the owner certificate artifact's CMS structure's
          top-most content type MUST be the OID id-signedData (1.2.840.113549.1.7.2).
          The inner SignedData structure is the degenerate form, whereby there
          are no signers, that is commonly used to disseminate certificates and
          revocation objects.</t>

          <t>When encrypted, the owner certificate artifact's CMS structure's

          by the device's manufacturer.</t>

          <t>The ownership voucher is used to verify the owner certificate
          (<xref target="owner-certificate"/>) that the device should have also
          received, as described in <xref target="artifact-groupings"/>.  In
          particular, the device verifies that the owner certificate has a chain
          of trust leading to the trusted certificate included in the ownership
          voucher ("pinned-domain-cert").  Note that this relationship holds
          even when the owner certificate is a self-signed certificate, and
          hence also the pinned-domain-cert.</t>

          <t>When unencrypted, the ownership voucher artifact is as defined

          <t>Each of the three artifacts MAY be individually encrypted.  Encryption
          may be important in some environments where the content is considered
          sensitive.</t>
          <t>Each of the three artifacts are encrypted in the same way, by the
          unencrypted form being encapsulated inside a CMS EnvelopedData type.</t>
          <t>As a consequence, both the conveyed information and ownership
          voucher artifacts are signed and then encrypted, never encrypted
          and then signed.</t>
          <t>This sequencing has the advantage of shrouding the signer's
          certificate, and ensuring that the owner knows the content being
          signed.  This sequencing further enables the owner to inspect an
          unencrypted voucher obtained from a manufacturer and then encrypt
          the voucher later themselves, perhaps while also stapling in 
          current revocation objects, when ready to place the artifact
          in an unsafe location.</t>
          <t>When encrypted, the CMS MUST be encrypted using a secure device
          identity certificate for the device.  This certificate MAY be the
          same as the TLS-level client certificate the device uses when
          connecting to bootstrap servers.  The owner must possess the
          device's identity certificate at the time of encrypting the data.
          How the owner comes to posses the device's identity certificate
          for this purpose is outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <section title="Sources of Bootstrapping Data" anchor="sources">

        <t>This section defines some sources for bootstrapping data that a device
        can access.  The list of sources defined here is not meant to be exhaustive.
        It is left to future documents to define additional sources for obtaining
        bootstrapping data.</t>

        <t>For each source of bootstrapping data defined in this section, details
        are given for how the three artifacts listed in <xref target="artifacts"/>
        are provided.</t>

        <section title="Removable Storage" anchor="removable-storage">
          <t>A directly attached removable storage device (e.g., a USB flash drive)
          MAY be used as a source of SZTP bootstrapping data.</t>

          <t>Use of a removable storage device is compelling, as it does not require
          any external infrastructure to work.  It is notable that the raw boot
          image file can also be located on the removable storage device, enabling
          a removable storage device to be a fully self-standing bootstrapping
          solution.</t>

          <t>To use a removable storage device as a source of bootstrapping data,
          a device need only detect if the removable storage device is plugged in
          and mount its filesystem.</t>

          <t>A removable storage device is an untrusted source of bootstrapping data.
          This means that the information stored on the removable storage device
          either MUST be signed or MUST be information that can be processed
          provisionally (e.g., unsigned redirect information).</t>

          <t>From an artifact perspective, since a removable storage device presents
          itself as a filesystem, the bootstrapping artifacts need to be presented
          as files.  The three artifacts defined in <xref target="artifacts"/> are
          mapped to files below.</t>

          <t>Artifact to File Mapping:
            <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
              <t hangText="   Conveyed Information:">Mapped to a file containing
              the binary artifact described in <xref target="conveyed-information"/>
              (e.g., conveyed-information.cms).</t>
              <t hangText="   Owner Certificate:">Mapped to a file containing the
              binary artifact described in <xref target="owner-certificate"/>
              (e.g., owner-certificate.cms).</t>
              <t hangText="   Ownership Voucher:">Mapped to a file containing the
              binary artifact described in <xref target="ownership-voucher"/>

            </list>
          </t>
          <t>The format of the removable storage device's filesystem and the naming of the
          files are outside the scope of this document.  However, in order to facilitate
          interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED devices support open and/or standards based
          filesystems.  It is also RECOMMENDED that devices assume a file naming convention
          that enables more than one instance of bootstrapping data (i.e., for different
          devices) to exist on a removable storage device.  The file naming convention 
          SHOULD additionally be unique to the manufacturer, in order to enable bootstrapping
          data from multiple manufacturers to exist on a removable storage device.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="DNS Server" anchor="dns-server">
          <t>A DNS server MAY be used as a source of SZTP bootstrapping data.</t>

          <t>Using a DNS server may be a compelling option for deployments having
          existing DNS infrastructure, as it enables a touchless bootstrapping option
          that does not entail utilizing an Internet based resource hosted by a
          3rd-party.</t>

          <t>DNS is an untrusted source of bootstrapping data.  Even if DNSSEC
          <xref target="RFC6698"/> is used to authenticate the various DNS resource
          records (e.g., A, AAAA, CERT, TXT, and TLSA), the device cannot be
          sure that the domain returned to it from e.g., a DHCP server, belongs
          to its rightful owner.  This means that the information stored in the
          DNS records either MUST be signed (per this document, not DNSSEC), or
          MUST be information that can be processed provisionally (e.g., unsigned
          redirect information).</t>

          <section title="DNS Queries" toc="exclude">

            <t>Devices claiming to support DNS as a source of bootstrapping
            data MUST first query for device-specific DNS records using DNS-SD
            <xref target="RFC6763"/> and, only if doing so does not result in a
            successful bootstrap, then query for device-independent records
            using traditional service discovery <xref target="RFC2782"/>.
            Furthermore, when issuing the device-specific and device-independent
            queries, devices MUST first query using multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762"/>
            and, only if doing so does not result in a successful bootstrap, then
            query again using unicast DNS <xref target="RFC1035"/><xref target="RFC7766"/>,
            assuming the address of a DNS server is known.</t>
  
            <t>When querying for device-specific DNS records, devices SHOULD
            immediately query for their instance-specific record, without first
            querying for PTR records (Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC6763"/>).
            Device MUST use their serial number (i.e., the same value as in the
            device identity certificate) for the "&lt;instance&gt;" portion of
            the service instance name (Section 4.1.1 of <xref target="RFC6763"/>).
            Device MUST only query for TXT records, in order to access the three
            bootstrapping artifacts defined in <xref target="artifacts"/>.</t>
  
            <t>When querying for device-independent DNS records, devices MUST only
            query for SRV records.  Multiple SRV records, each specifying an address,
            port, weight, and priority <xref target="RFC2782"/> is comparable to 
            an unsigned redirect information's list of bootstrap servers.  Note
            that a device-independent response is only able to encode unsigned
            data, since signed data necessitates the use of a device-specific
            ownership voucher.  Exclusive use of SRV records maximally leverages
            existing DNS standards for what is likely to be a common case when
            using a DNS server as a source of bootstrapping data.</t>
 
            <t>By example, assuming a device's serial number is "&lt;serial number&gt;",
            and that the domain discovered per Section 11 of <xref target="RFC6763"/>
            is "example.com", the device may issue the following sequence of DNS queries:
              <?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
              <list style="empty">
                <t>TXT in &lt;serial number&gt;._sztp._tcp.local.</t>

          <section title="Size of Signed Data" toc="exclude">

            <t>The signed data artifacts are large by DNS conventions.  In the
            smallest-footprint scenario, they are each a few kilobytes in size.
            However, onboarding information can easily be several kilobytes in
            size, and has the potential to be many kilobytes in size.</t>
  
            <t>All resource records, including TXT records, have an upper
            size limit of 65535 bytes, since "RDLENGTH" is a 16-bit field
            (Section 3.2.1 in <xref target="RFC1035"/>).  If it is ever 
            desired to encode onboarding information that exceeds this
            limit, the DNS records returned should instead encode redirect
            information, to direct the device to a bootstrap server from
            which the onboarding information can be obtained.</t>
  
            <t>Given the expected size of the TXT records, it is unlikely
            that signed data will fit into a UDP-based DNS packet, even
            with the EDNS(0) Extensions <xref target="RFC6891"/> enabled.
            Depending on content, signed data may also not fit into a
            multicast DNS packet, which bounds the size of the TXT records
            to 8900 bytes, per Section 6.1 in <xref target="RFC6763"/>.  Thus
            it is expected that DNS Transport over TCP <xref target="RFC7766"/>
            will be required in order to return signed data.</t>

          <t>A DHCP server MAY be used as a source of SZTP bootstrapping data.</t>

          <t>Using a DHCP server may be a compelling option for deployments having
          existing DHCP infrastructure, as it enables a touchless bootstrapping option
          that does not entail utilizing an Internet based resource hosted by a
          3rd-party.</t>

          <t>A DHCP server is an untrusted source of bootstrapping data.  Thus the
          information stored on the DHCP server either MUST be signed, or it MUST
          be information that can be processed provisionally (e.g., unsigned redirect
          information).</t>

          <t>However, unlike other sources of bootstrapping data described
          in this document, the DHCP protocol (especially DHCP for IPv4) is very
          limited in the amount of data that can be conveyed, to the extent that
          signed data cannot be communicated.  This means that only unsigned
          redirect information can be conveyed via DHCP.</t>

          <t>Since the redirect information is unsigned, it SHOULD NOT include the
          optional trust anchor certificate, as it takes up space in the DHCP
          message, and the device would have to discard it anyway.  For this
          reason, the DHCP options defined in <xref target="dhcp-options"/> do
          not enable the trust anchor certificate to be encoded.</t>

          <t>From an artifact perspective, the three artifacts defined in
          <xref target="artifacts"/> are mapped to the DHCP fields specified in
          <xref target="dhcp-options"/> as follows.</t>

          <t>A bootstrap server MAY be used as a source of SZTP bootstrapping data.
          A bootstrap server is defined as a RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>
          server implementing the YANG module provided in <xref target="api"/>.</t>

          <t>Using a bootstrap server as a source of bootstrapping data is a compelling
          option as it MAY use transport-level security, obviating the need for signed
          data, which may be easier to deploy in some situations.</t>

          <t>Unlike any other source of bootstrapping data described in this document,
          a bootstrap server is not only a source of data, but it can also receive data
          from devices using the YANG-defined "report-progress" RPC defined in the YANG
          module (<xref target="yang-module"/>).  The "report-progress" RPC enables
          visibility into the bootstrapping process (e.g., warnings and errors), and
          provides potentially useful information upon completion (e.g., the device's
          SSH host-keys).</t>

          <t>A bootstrap server may be a trusted or an untrusted source of bootstrapping
          data, depending on if the device learned about the bootstrap server's trust
          anchor from a trusted source.  When a bootstrap server is trusted, the
          conveyed information returned from it MAY be signed.  When the bootstrap server is
          untrusted, the conveyed information either MUST be signed or MUST be information
          that can be processed provisionally (e.g., unsigned redirect information).</t>

          <t>From an artifact perspective, since a bootstrap server presents data
          conforming to a YANG data model, the bootstrapping artifacts need to be
          mapped to YANG nodes.  The three artifacts defined in <xref target="artifacts"/>
          are mapped to "output" nodes of the "get-bootstrapping-data" RPC defined
          in <xref target="yang-module"/> below.</t>

              <t hangText="   Owner Certificate:">Mapped to the "owner-certificate"

              leaf in the output of the "get-bootstrapping-data" RPC.</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>SZTP bootstrap servers have only two endpoints, one for the
          "get-bootstrapping-data" RPC and one for the "report-progress" RPC.
          These RPCs use the authenticated RESTCONF username to isolate the
          execution of the RPC from other devices.</t>

              <t>Devices MUST have a configurable variable that is used to enable/disable
              SZTP bootstrapping.  This variable MUST be enabled by default in
              order for SZTP bootstrapping to run when the device first powers on.
              Because it is a goal that the configuration installed by the bootstrapping
              process disables SZTP bootstrapping, and because the
              configuration may be merged into the existing configuration, using a
              configuration node that relies on presence is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it
              cannot be removed by the merging process.</t>

              <t>Devices that support loading bootstrapping data from bootstrap servers
              (see <xref target="bootstrap-server"/>) SHOULD possess a TLS-level client

              well-known trust-anchor.  The well-known trust anchor certificate may
              be an intermediate certificate or a self-signed root certificate.  To
              support devices not having a client certificate, devices MAY, alternatively
              or in addition to, identify and authenticate themselves to the bootstrap
              server using an HTTP authentication scheme, as allowed by Section 2.5 in

              bootstrap servers MUST also possess a list of trust anchor certificates

        <section title="Processing a Source of Bootstrapping Data" anchor="processing-a-source">
          <t>This section describes a recursive algorithm that devices can use to,
          ultimately, obtain onboarding information.  The algorithm is recursive
          because sources of bootstrapping data may return redirect information,
          which causes the algorithm to run again, for the newly discovered sources
          of bootstrapping data.  An expression that captures all possible
          successful sequences of bootstrapping data is: zero or more redirect
          information responses, followed by one onboarding information response.</t>

          <t>An important aspect of the algorithm is knowing when data needs to be
          signed or not.  The following figure provides a summary of options:
          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[

    Signed Redirect Info       :       Yes              Yes*
    Unsigned Onboarding Info   :        No              Yes
    Signed Onboarding Info     :       Yes              Yes*

    The '+' above denotes that the source redirected to MUST
    return signed data, or more unsigned redirect information.

    The '*' above denotes that, while possible, it is generally
    unnecessary for a trusted source to return signed data.
]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

          <t>The recursive algorithm uses a conceptual global-scoped variable
          called "trust-state".  The trust-state variable is initialized to FALSE.
          The ultimate goal of this algorithm is for the device to process
          onboarding information (<xref target="onboarding-information"/>)
          while the trust-state variable is TRUE.</t>

          <t>If the source of bootstrapping data (<xref target="sources"/>) is a
          bootstrap server (<xref target="bootstrap-server"/>), and the device is
          able to authenticate the bootstrap server using X.509 certificate path
          validation (<xref target="RFC6125"/>, Section 6) to one of the device's
          preconfigured trust anchors, or to a trust anchor that it learned
          from a previous step, then the device MUST set trust-state to TRUE.</t>

          <t>When establishing a connection to a bootstrap server, whether
          trusted or untrusted, the device MUST identify and authenticate
          itself to the bootstrap server using a TLS-level client certificate
          and/or an HTTP authentication scheme, per Section 2.5 in 
          <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  If both authentication mechanisms
          are used, they MUST both identify the same serial number.</t>

          <t>When sending a client certificate, the device MUST also send all of
          the intermediate certificates leading up to, and optionally including,
          the client certificate's well-known trust anchor certificate.</t>

          <t>For any source of bootstrapping data (e.g., <xref target="sources"/>),
          if any artifact obtained is encrypted, the device MUST first decrypt it
          using the private key associated with the device certificate used to
          encrypt the artifact.</t>

          <t>If the conveyed information artifact is signed, and the device
          is able to validate the signed data using the algorithm described in
          <xref target="validating-signed-data"/>, then the device MUST set
          trust-state to TRUE; otherwise, if the device is unable to validate
          the signed data, the device MUST set trust-state to FALSE.  Note,
          this is worded to cover the special case when signed data is returned
          even from a trusted source of bootstrapping data.</t>

          <t>If the conveyed information artifact contains redirect information,
          the device MUST, within limits of how many recursive loops the device
          allows, process the redirect information as described in
          <xref target="process-redirect-information"/>.  Implementations MUST
          limit the maximum number of recursive redirects allowed; the maximum
          number of recursive redirects allowed SHOULD be no more than ten.
          This is the recursion step, it will cause the device to reenter this
          algorithm, but this time the data source will definitely be a bootstrap
          server, as redirect information is only able to redirect devices to
          bootstrap servers.</t>

          <t>If the conveyed information artifact contains onboarding information, and
          trust-state is FALSE, the device MUST exit the recursive algorithm (as
          this is not allowed, see the figure above), returning to the bootstrapping
          sequence described in <xref target="boot-sequence"/>.  Otherwise, the device
          MUST attempt to process the onboarding information as described in
          <xref target="process-onboarding-information"/>.  Whether the processing
          of the onboarding information succeeds or fails, the device MUST exit the
          recursive algorithm, returning to the bootstrapping sequence described
          in <xref target="boot-sequence"/>, the only difference being in how it
          responds to the "Able to bootstrap from any source?" conditional described
          in the figure in the section.</t>

        <section title="Validating Signed Data" anchor="validating-signed-data">
          <t>Whenever a device is presented signed data, it MUST validate the
          signed data as described in this section.  This includes the case
          where the signed data is provided by a trusted source.</t>
          <t>Whenever there is signed data, the device MUST also be provided
          an ownership voucher and an owner certificate.  How all the needed
          artifacts are provided for each source of bootstrapping data is
          described in <xref target="sources"/>.</t>
          <t>In order to validate signed data, the device MUST first 
          authenticate the ownership voucher by validating its signature to one
          of its preconfigured trust anchors (see <xref target="initial-state"/>),
          which may entail using additional intermediate certificates attached
          to the ownership voucher.  If the device has an accurate clock,
          it MUST verify that the ownership voucher was created in the past
          (i.e., "created-on" &lt; now) and, if the "expires-on" leaf is present,
          the device MUST verify that the ownership voucher has not yet expired
          (i.e., now &lt; "expires-on").  The device MUST verify that the ownership
          voucher's "assertion" value is acceptable (e.g., some devices may only
          accept the assertion value "verified").  The device MUST verify that
          the ownership voucher specifies the device's serial number in the
          "serial-number" leaf.  If the "idevid-issuer" leaf is present, the
          device MUST verify that the value is set correctly.  If the authentication
          of the ownership voucher is successful, the device extracts the 
          "pinned-domain-cert" node, an X.509 certificate, that is
          needed to verify the owner certificate in the next step.</t>
          <t>The device MUST next authenticate the owner certificate by performing
          X.509 certificate path verification to the trusted certificate extracted
          from the ownership voucher's "pinned-domain-cert" node.  This verification
          may entail using additional intermediate certificates attached to the
          owner certificate artifact.  If the ownership voucher's
          "domain-cert-revocation-checks" node's value is set to "true", the device
          MUST verify the revocation status of the certificate chain used to sign
          the owner certificate and, if suitably-fresh revocation status is unattainable or
          if it is determined that a certificate has been revoked, the device
          MUST NOT validate the owner certificate.</t>
          <t>Finally, the device MUST verify that the conveyed information
          artifact was signed by the validated owner certificate.</t>
          <t>If any of these steps fail, the device MUST invalidate the
          signed data and not perform any subsequent steps.</t>

        <section title="Processing Redirect Information" anchor="process-redirect-information">
          <t>In order to process redirect information (<xref target="redirect-information"/>),
          the device MUST follow the steps presented in this section.</t>

          <t>Processing redirect information is straightforward; the device sequentially
          steps through the list of provided bootstrap servers until it can find one it
          can bootstrap from.</t>

          <t>If a hostname is provided, and the hostname's DNS resolution is to more
          than one IP address, the device MUST attempt to connect to all of the DNS
          resolved addresses at least once, before moving on to the next bootstrap
          server.  If the device is able to obtain bootstrapping data from any of the
          DNS resolved addresses, it MUST immediately process that data, without
          attempting to connect to any of the other DNS resolved addresses.</t>

          <t>If the redirect information is trusted (e.g., trust-state is TRUE), and the
          bootstrap server entry contains a trust anchor certificate, then the device MUST
          authenticate the specified bootstrap server's TLS server certificate
          using X.509 certificate path validation (<xref target="RFC6125"/>, Section 6)
          to the specified trust anchor.  If the bootstrap server entry does not contain
          a trust anchor certificate device, the device MUST establish a provisional
          connection to the bootstrap server (i.e., by blindly accepting its server
          certificate), and set trust-state to FALSE.</t>

          <t>If the redirect information is untrusted (e.g., trust-state is FALSE), the
          device MUST discard any trust anchors provided by the redirect information and
          establish a provisional connection to the bootstrap server (i.e., by blindly
          accepting its TLS server certificate).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Processing Onboarding Information" anchor="process-onboarding-information">
          <t>In order to process onboarding information (<xref target="onboarding-information"/>),
          the device MUST follow the steps presented in this section.</t>

          <t>When processing onboarding information, the device MUST first process the
          boot image information (if any), then execute the pre-configuration script
          (if any), then commit the initial configuration (if any), and then execute
          the post-configuration script (if any), in that order.</t>

          <t>When the onboarding information is obtained from a trusted bootstrap server,
          the device MUST send the "bootstrap-initiated" progress report, and send either
          a terminating "boot-image-installed-rebooting", "bootstrap-complete", or error
          specific progress report.  If the bootstrap server's "get-bootstrapping-data"
          RPC-reply's "reporting-level" node is set to "verbose", the device MUST
          additionally send all appropriate non-terminating progress reports (e.g.,
          initiated, warning, complete, etc.).  Regardless of the reporting-level indicated
          by the bootstrap server, the device MAY send progress reports beyond the
          mandatory ones specified for the given reporting level.</t>

          <t>When the onboarding information is obtained from an untrusted bootstrap
          server, the device MUST NOT send any progress reports to the bootstrap server,
          even though the onboarding information was, necessarily, signed and authenticated.
          Please be aware that bootstrap servers are recommended to promote untrusted
          connections to trusted connections, in the last paragraph of Section 9.6, so
          as to, in part, be able to collect progress reports from devices.</t>
 
          <t>If the device encounters an error at any step, it MUST stop processing the
          onboarding information and return to the bootstrapping sequence described in
          <xref target="boot-sequence"/>. In the context of a recursive algorithm, the
          device MUST return to the enclosing loop, not back to the very beginning.
          Some state MAY be retained from the bootstrapping process (e.g., updated
          boot image, logs, remnants from a script, etc.).  However, the retained
          state MUST NOT be active in any way (e.g., no new configuration or running
          of software), and MUST NOT hinder the ability for the device to continue
          the bootstrapping sequence (i.e., process onboarding information from
          another bootstrap server).</t>

          <t>At this point, the specific ordered sequence of actions the device MUST
          perform is described.</t>

          <t>If the onboarding information is obtained from a trusted bootstrap server,
          the device MUST send a "bootstrap-initiated" progress report.  It is an error
          if the device does not receive back the "204 No Content" HTTP status line.
          If an error occurs, the device MUST try to send a "bootstrap-error" progress
          report before exiting.</t>

          <t>The device MUST parse the provided onboarding information document, to 
          extract values used in subsequent steps.  Whether using a stream-based parser
          or not, if there is an error when parsing the onboarding information, and the
          device is connected to a trusted bootstrap server, the device MUST try to send
          a "parsing-error" progress report before exiting.</t>

          <t>If boot image criteria are specified, the device MUST first determine if the
          boot image it is running satisfies the specified boot image criteria.  If the 
          device is already running the specified boot image, then it skips the remainder
          of this step.  If the device is not running the specified boot image, then it
          MUST download, verify, and install, in that order, the specified boot
          image, and then reboot.  If connected to a trusted bootstrap server, the
          device MAY try to send a "boot-image-mismatch" progress report.  To download
          the boot image, the device MUST only use the URIs supplied by the onboarding
          information.  To verify the boot image, the device MUST either use one of the
          verification fingerprints supplied by the onboarding information, or use a
          cryptographic signature embedded into the boot image itself using a mechanism
          not described by this document.  Before rebooting, if connected to a trusted
          bootstrap server, the device MUST try to send a "boot-image-installed-rebooting"
          progress report.  Upon rebooting, the bootstrapping process runs again, which
          will eventually come to this step again, but then the device will be running
          the specified boot image, and thus will move to processing the next step.  If
          an error occurs at any step while the device is connected to a trusted
          bootstrap server (i.e., before the reboot), the device MUST try to send
          a "boot-image-error" progress report before exiting.</t>

          <t>If a pre-configuration script has been specified, the device MUST execute the
          script, capture any output emitted from the script, and check if the script had
          any warnings or errors.  If an error occurs while the device is connected to a
          trusted bootstrap server, the device MUST try to send a "pre-script-error"
          progress report before exiting.</t>
 
          <t>If an initial configuration has been specified, the device MUST atomically
          commit the provided initial configuration, using the approach specified by the 
          "configuration-handling" leaf.  If an error occurs while the device is connected
          to a trusted bootstrap server, the device MUST try to send a "config-error"
          progress report before exiting.</t>

          <t>If a post-configuration script has been specified, the device MUST execute the
          script, capture any output emitted from the script, and check if the script had
          any warnings or errors. If an error occurs while the device is connected to a
          trusted bootstrap server, the device MUST try to send a "post-script-error"
          progress report before exiting.</t>

          <t>If the onboarding information was obtained from a trusted bootstrap server,
          and the result of the bootstrapping process did not disable the "flag to enable
          SZTP bootstrapping" described in <xref target="initial-state"/>, the device
          SHOULD send an "bootstrap-warning" progress report.</t>

          <t>If the onboarding information was obtained from a trusted bootstrap server,
          the device MUST send a "bootstrap-complete" progress report.  It is an error
          if the device does not receive back the "204 No Content" HTTP status line.
          If an error occurs, the device MUST try to send a "bootstrap-error" progress
          report before exiting.</t>

          <t>At this point, the device has completely processed the bootstrapping
          data.</t>

          <t>The device is now running its initial configuration.  Notably,
          if NETCONF Call Home or RESTCONF Call Home <xref target="RFC8071"/> is
          configured, the device initiates trying to establish the call home
          connections at this time.</t>

          <t>Implementation Notes:
           <list>
            <t>Implementations may vary in how to ensure no unwanted state is retained
            when an error occurs.</t>
            <t>Following are some guidelines for if the implementation chooses to undo
            previous steps:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>When an error occurs, the device must rollback the current step and
                any previous steps.</t>
                <t>Most steps are atomic.  For example, the processing of a configuration
                is specified above as atomic, and the processing of scripts is similarly
                specified as atomic in the "ietf-sztp-conveyed-info" YANG module.</t>
                <t>In case the error occurs after the initial configuration was committed,
                the device must restore the configuration to the configuration that
                existed prior to the configuration being committed.</t>
                <t>In case the error occurs after a script had executed successfully,
                it may be helpful for the implementation to define scripts as being
                able to take a conceptual input parameter indicating that the script
                should remove its previously set state.</t>

          <t>DHCPv4 Client Behavior</t>
          <t>Clients MAY request the OPTION_V4_SZTP_REDIRECT by including its
          option code in the Parameter Request List (55) in DHCP request messages.</t>
          <t>On receipt of a DHCPv4 Reply message which contains the
          OPTION_V4_SZTP_REDIRECT, the client processes the response according
          to <xref target="process-redirect-information"/>, with the understanding
          that the "address" and "port" values are encoded in the URIs.</t>
          <t>Any invalid URI entries received in the uri-data field are ignored by
          the client.  If OPTION_V4_SZTP_REDIRECT does not contain at least one
          valid URI entry in the uri-data field, then the client MUST discard the
          option.</t>

          <t>As the list of URIs may exceed the maximum allowed length of
            a single DHCPv4 option (255 octets), the client MUST implement
            <xref target="RFC3396"/>, allowing the URI list to be split
            across a number of OPTION_V4_SZTP_REDIRECT option
            instances.
          </t>

          <t>DHCPv4 Server Behavior</t>
          <t>The DHCPv4 server MAY include a single instance of Option
            OPTION_V4_SZTP_REDIRECT in DHCP messages it sends.  Servers MUST
            NOT send more than one instance of the OPTION_V4_SZTP_REDIRECT option.
          </t>

          <t>The server’s DHCP message MUST contain only a single instance of the
          OPTION_V4_SZTP_REDIRECT’s 'bootstrap-server-list’
          field. However, the list of URIs in this field may exceed the maximum
          allowed length of a single DHCPv4 option (per <xref target="RFC3396"/>).
          </t>

          <t>If the length of 'bootstrap-server-list’ is small enough to fit into
          a single instance of OPTION_V4_SZTP_REDIRECT,  the server MUST NOT
          send more than one instance of this option.</t>

          <t>If the length of the 'bootstrap-server-list’ field is too large to
          fit into a single option, then OPTION_V4_SZTP_REDIRECT MUST be
          split into multiple instances of the option according to the process
          described in <xref target="RFC3396"/>.</t>

      <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-con">
        <section title="Clock Sensitivity" anchor="clock-sens">
          <t>The solution in this document relies on TLS certificates,
          owner certificates, and ownership vouchers, all of which
          require an accurate clock in order to be processed
          correctly (e.g., to test validity dates and revocation
          status).  Implementations SHOULD ensure devices have an
          accurate clock when shipped from manufacturing facilities,
          and take steps to prevent clock tampering.</t>
          <t>If it is not possible to ensure clock accuracy, it is
          RECOMMENDED that implementations disable the aspects of the
          solution having clock sensitivity. In particular, such
          implementations should assume that TLS certificates,
          ownership vouchers, and owner certificates never expire
          and are not revokable.  From an ownership voucher
          perspective, manufacturers SHOULD issue a single
          ownership voucher for the lifetime of such devices.</t>
          <t>Implementations SHOULD NOT rely on NTP for time, as
          NTP is not a secure protocol at this time.  Note, there
          is an IETF work-in-progress to secure NTP 
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-ntp-using-nts-for-ntp"/>.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Use of IDevID Certificates">
          <t>IDevID certificates, as defined in <xref target="Std-802.1AR-2009"/>,
          are RECOMMENDED, both for the TLS-level client certificate used
          by devices when connecting to a bootstrap server, as well as for
          the device identity certificate used by owners when encrypting
          the SZTP bootstrapping data artifacts.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Immutable Storage for Trust Anchors">
          <t>Devices MUST ensure that all their trust anchor certificates,
          including those for connecting to bootstrap servers and verifying
          ownership vouchers, are protected from external modification.</t>
          <t>It may be necessary to update these certificates over time 
          (e.g., the manufacturer wants to delegate trust to a new CA).
          It is therefore expected that devices MAY update these trust
          anchors when needed through a verifiable process, such as a
          software upgrade using signed software images.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Secure Storage for Long-lived Private Keys">
          <t>Manufacturer-generated device identifiers may have very long
          lifetimes.  For instance, <xref target="Std-802.1AR-2009"/>
          recommends using the "notAfter" value 99991231235959Z in IDevID
          certificates.  Given the long-lived nature of these private keys,
          it is paramount that they are stored so as to resist discovery,
          such as in a secure cryptographic processor, such as a trusted
          platform module (TPM) chip.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Blindly Authenticating a Bootstrap Server">
          <t>This document allows a device to blindly authenticate a
          bootstrap server's TLS certificate.  It does so to allow
          for cases where the redirect information may be obtained
          in an unsecured manner, which is desirable to support
          in some cases.</t>
          <t>To compensate for this, this document requires that
          devices, when connected to an untrusted bootstrap server,
          assert that data downloaded from the server is signed.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Disclosing Information to Untrusted Servers">
          <t>This document allows devices to establish connections to
          untrusted bootstrap servers.  However, since the bootstrap
          server is untrusted, it may be under the control of an
          adversary, and therefore devices SHOULD be cautious about
          the data they send to the bootstrap server in such cases.</t>
          <t>Devices send different data to bootstrap servers at each
          of the protocol layers TCP, TLS, HTTP, and RESTCONF.</t>
          <t>At the TCP protocol layer, devices may relay their IP address,
          subject to network translations.  Disclosure of this information
          is not considered a security risk.</t>
          <t>At the TLS protocol layer, devices may use a client certificate
          to identify and authenticate themselves to untrusted bootstrap
          servers.  At a minimum, the client certificate must disclose
          the device's serial number, and may disclose additional information
          such as the device's manufacturer, hardware model, public key, etc.
          Knowledge of this information may provide an adversary with details
          needed to launch an attack.  It is RECOMMENDED that secrecy of the
          network constituency is not relied on for security.</t>
          <t>At the HTTP protocol layer, devices may use an HTTP authentication
          scheme to identify and authenticate themselves to untrusted bootstrap
          servers.  At a minimum, the authentication scheme must disclose the
          device's serial number and, concerningly, may, depending on the
          authentication mechanism used, reveal a secret that is only supposed
          to be known to the device (e.g., a password).  Devices SHOULD NOT use
          an HTTP authentication scheme (e.g., HTTP Basic) with an untrusted
          bootstrap server that reveals a secret that is only supposed to be
          known to the device.</t>
          <t>At the RESTCONF protocol layer, devices use the "get-bootstrapping-data"
          RPC, but not the "report-progress" RPC, when connected to an untrusted
          bootstrap server.  The "get-bootstrapping-data" RPC allows additional
          input parameters to be passed to the bootstrap server (e.g., "os-name",
          "os-version", "hw-model").  It is RECOMMENDED that devices only pass
          the "signed-data-preferred" input parameter to an untrusted bootstrap
          server.  While it is okay for a bootstrap server to immediately
          return signed onboarding information, it is RECOMMENDED that
          bootstrap servers instead promote the untrusted connection to a
          trusted connection, as described in <xref target="untrust2trust"/>,
          thus enabling the device to use the "report-progress" RPC while
          processing the onboarding information.</t>
       </section>
        <section title="Sequencing Sources of Bootstrapping Data">
          <t>For devices supporting more than one source for bootstrapping
          data, no particular sequencing order has to be observed for
          security reasons, as the solution for each source is considered
          equally secure.  However, from a privacy perspective, it is
          RECOMMENDED that devices access local sources before accessing
          remote sources.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Safety of Private Keys used for Trust">
          <t>The solution presented in this document enables bootstrapping
          data to be trusted in two ways, either through transport level
          security or through the signing of artifacts.</t>
          <t>When transport level security (i.e., a trusted bootstrap server)
          is used, the private key for the end-entity certificate must be
          online in order to establish the TLS connection.</t>
          <t>When artifacts are signed, the signing key is required to be
          online only when the bootstrap server is returning a dynamically
          generated signed-data response.  For instance, a bootstrap server,
          upon receiving the "signed-data-preferred" input parameter to the
          "get-bootstrapping-data" RPC, may dynamically generate a response
          that is signed.</t>
          <t>Bootstrap server administrators are RECOMMENDED to follow best
          practice to protect the private key used for any online operation.
          For instance, use of a hardware security module (HSM) is RECOMMENDED.
          If an HSM is not used, frequent private key refreshes are RECOMMENDED,
          assuming all bootstrapping devices have an accurate clock (see
          <xref target="clock-sens"/>).</t>
          <t>For best security, it is RECOMMENDED that owners only provide
          bootstrapping data that has been signed, using a protected private
          key, and encrypted, using the device's public key from its secure
          device identity certificate.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Increased Reliance on Manufacturers">
          <t>The SZTP bootstrapping protocol presented in this document shifts
          some control of initial configuration away from the rightful owner of the
          device and towards the manufacturer and its delegates.</t>
          <t>The manufacturer maintains the list of well-known bootstrap servers
          its devices will trust.  By design, if no bootstrapping data is found via
          other methods first, the device will try to reach out to the well-known
          bootstrap servers.  There is no mechanism to prevent this from occurring
          other than by using an external firewall to block such connections.
          Concerns related to trusted bootstrap servers are discussed in 
          <xref target="seccon-trusted-bootstrap-servers"/>.</t>
          <t>Similarly, the manufacturer maintains the list of voucher signing
          authorities its devices will trust.  The voucher signing authorities
          issue the vouchers that enable a device to trust an owner's domain
          certificate.  It is vital that manufacturers ensure the integrity
          of these voucher signing authorities, so as to avoid incorrect
          assignments.</t>
          <t>Operators should be aware that this system assumes that they trust
          all the pre-configured bootstrap servers and voucher signing authorities
          designated by the manufacturers.  While operators may use points in
          the network to block access to the well-known bootstrap servers,
          operators cannot prevent voucher signing authorities from generating
          vouchers for their devices.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Concerns with Trusted Bootstrap Servers"
                 anchor="seccon-trusted-bootstrap-servers">
          <t>Trusted bootstrap servers, whether well-known or discovered,
          have the potential to cause problems, such as the following.
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>A trusted bootstrap server that has been compromised may be
              modified to return unsigned data of any sort.  For instance, a
              bootstrap server that is only suppose to return redirect 
              information might be modified to return onboarding information.
              Similarly, a bootstrap server that is only supposed to return
              signed data, may be modified to return unsigned data.  In both
              cases, the device will accept the response, unaware that it
              wasn't supposed to be any different.  It is RECOMMENDED that
              maintainers of trusted bootstrap servers ensure that their
              systems are not easily compromised and, in case of compromise,
              have mechanisms in place to detect and remediate the compromise
              as expediently as possible.</t>
              <t>A trusted bootstrap server hosting either unsigned, or signed
              but not encrypted, data may disclose information to unwanted parties
              (e.g., an administrator of the bootstrap server).  This is a privacy
              issue only, but could reveal information that might be used in a
              subsequent attack.  Disclosure of redirect information has limited
              exposure (it is just a list of bootstrap servers), whereas disclosure
              of onboarding information could be highly revealing (e.g., network
              topology, firewall policies, etc.).  It is RECOMMENDED that operators
              encrypt the bootstrapping data when its contents are considered 
              sensitive, even to the point of hiding it from the administrators
              of the bootstrap server, which may be maintained by a 3rd-party.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Validity Period for Conveyed Information">
          <t>The conveyed information artifact does not specify a validity period.  For
          instance, neither redirect information nor onboarding information
          enable "not-before" or "not-after" values to be specified, and
          neither artifact alone can be revoked.</t>

          <t>For unsigned data provided by an untrusted source of bootstrapping
          data, it is not meaningful to discuss its validity period when the
          information itself has no authenticity and may have come from anywhere.</t>

          <t>For unsigned data provided by a trusted source of bootstrapping
          data (i.e., a bootstrap server), the availability of the data
          is the only measure of it being current.  Since the untrusted data
          comes from a trusted source, its current availability is meaningful
          and, since bootstrap servers use TLS, the contents of the exchange
          cannot be modified or replayed.</t>

          <t>For signed data, whether provided by an untrusted or trusted
          source of bootstrapping data, the validity is constrained by
          the validity of the both the ownership voucher and owner
          certificate used to authenticate it.</t>
          
          <t>The ownership voucher's validity is primarily constrained by 
          the ownership voucher's "created-on" and "expires-on" nodes.  
          While <xref target="RFC8366"/> recommends short-lived vouchers
          (see Section 6.1), the "expires-on" node may be set to any point
          in the future, or omitted altogether to indicate that the voucher
          never expires.  The ownership voucher's validity is secondarily
          constrained by the manufacturer's PKI used to sign the voucher;
          whilst an ownership voucher cannot be revoked directly, the PKI
          used to sign it may be.</t>

          <t>The owner certificate's validity is primarily constrained by
          the X.509's validity field, the "notBefore" and "notAfter" values,
          as specified by the certificate authority that signed it.  The
          owner certificate's validity is secondarily constrained by the
          validity of the PKI used to sign the voucher.  Owner certificates
          may be revoked directly.</t>

          <t>For owners that wish to have maximum flexibility in their
          ability to specify and constrain the validity of signed data,
          it is RECOMMENDED that a unique owner certificate is created
          for each signed artifact.  Not only does this enable a
          validity period to be specified, for each artifact, but it
          also enables to the validity of each artifact to be revoked.</t>

          <t>When the redirect information is trusted, the redirect
          information can encode a trust anchor certificate used by
          the device to authenticate the TLS end-entity certificate
          presented by each bootstrap server.</t>

        <section title="Possible Reuse of Private Keys">
          <t>This document describes two uses for secure device identity
          certificates.</t>
          <t>The primary use is for when the device authenticates
          itself to a bootstrap server, using its private key for
          TLS-level client-certificate based authentication.</t>
          <t>A secondary use is for when the device needs to decrypt
          provided bootstrapping artifacts, using its private key
          to decrypt the data or, more precisely, per Section 6 in 
          <xref target="RFC5652"/>, decrypt a symmetric key used to
          decrypt the data.</t>
          <t>This document, in <xref target="artifact-encryption"/>
          allows for the possibility that the same secure device
          identity certificate is used for both uses, as 
          <xref target="Std-802.1AR-2009"/> states that a DevID
          certificate MAY have the "keyEncipherment" KeyUsage bit,
          in addition to the "digitalSignature" KeyUsage bit, set.</t>
          <t>While it is understood that it is generally frowned
          upon to reuse private keys, this document views such
          reuse acceptable as there are not any known ways to cause
          a signature made in one context to be (mis)interpreted
          as valid in the other context.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Non-Issue with Encrypting Signed Artifacts">
          <t>This document specifies the encryption of signed objects,
          as opposed to the signing of encrypted objects, as might
          be expected given well-publicized oracle attacks (e.g., the
          padding oracle attack).</t>
          <t>This document does not view such attacks as feasible in
          the context of the solution because the decrypted text never
          leaves the device.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="The &quot;ietf-sztp-conveyed-info&quot; YANG Module">
          <t>The ietf-sztp-conveyed-info module defined in this document
          defines a data structure that is always wrapped by a CMS structure.
          When accessed by a secure mechanism (e.g., protected by TLS), then the
          CMS structure may be unsigned.  However, when accessed by an insecure
          mechanism (e.g., removable storage device), then the CMS structure
          must be signed, in order for the device to trust it.</t>
          <t>Implementations should be aware that signed bootstrapping data
          only protects the data from modification, and that the contents are still
          visible to others.  This doesn't affect security so much as privacy.
          That the contents may be read by unintended parties when accessed by
          insecure mechanisms is considered next.</t>
          <t>The ietf-sztp-conveyed-info module defines a top-level "choice"
          statement that declares the contents are either "redirect-information"
          or "onboarding-information".  Each of these two cases are now considered.</t>
          <t>When the content of the CMS structure is redirect-information,
          an observer can learn about the bootstrap servers the device is being
          directed to, their IP addresses or hostnames, ports, and trust anchor
          certificates.  Knowledge of this information could provide an observer
          some insight into a network's inner structure.</t>
          <t>When the content of the CMS structure is onboarding information,
          an observer could learn considerable information about how the device
          is to be provisioned.  This information includes the operating system
          version, initial configuration, and script contents.  This information
          should be considered sensitive and precautions should be taken to 
          protect it (e.g., encrypt the artifact using the device's public key).</t>

          unable to authenticate the bootstrap server's TLS certificate.
          Because the device is unable to trust the bootstrap server, it
          sends the "signed-data-preferred" input parameter, and optionally
          also the "nonce" input parameter, in the "get-bootstrapping-data"
          RPC.  The "signed-data-preferred" parameter informs the
          bootstrap server that the device does not trust it and may
          be holding back some additional input parameters from the
          server (e.g., other input parameters, progress reports, etc.).
          The "nonce" input parameter enables the bootstrap server to
          dynamically obtain an ownership voucher from a MASA, which
          may be important for devices that do not have a reliable clock.</t>
          <t>The bootstrap server, seeing the "signed-data-preferred"
          input parameter, knows that it can either send unsigned
          redirect information or signed data of any type.  But, in
          this case, the bootstrap server has the ability to sign
          data and chooses to respond with signed redirect information,
          not signed onboarding information as might be expected,
          securely redirecting the device back to it again.  Not
          displayed but, if the "nonce" input parameter was passed,
          the bootstrap server could dynamically connect to a 
          download a voucher from the MASA having the nonce value
          in it.  Details regarding a protocol enabling this integration
          is outside the scope of this document.</t>
          <t>Upon validating the signed redirect information, the
          device establishes a secure connection to the bootstrap
          server.  Unbeknownst to the device, it is the same bootstrap
          server it was connected to previously but, because the device
          is able to authenticate the bootstrap server this time, it sends its
          normal "get-bootstrapping-data" request (i.e., with additional
          input parameters) as well as its progress reports (not depicted).</t>
          <t>This time, because the "signed-data-preferred" parameter was
          not passed, having access to all of the device's input parameters,
          the bootstrap server returns, in this example, unsigned onboarding
          information to the device.  Note also that, because the bootstrap
          server is now trusted, the device will send progress reports to
          the server.</t>

          in the diagram above.
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>A prospective owner of a manufacturer's devices initiates an
              enrollment process with the manufacturer.  This process includes
              the following:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Regardless how the prospective owner intends to bootstrap their devices,
                they will always obtain from the manufacturer the trust anchor
                certificate for the IDevID certificates.  This certificate will
                is installed on the prospective owner's NMS so that the NMS can
                authenticate the IDevID certificates when they are presented to
                subsequent steps.</t>
                <t>If the manufacturer hosts an Internet based bootstrap server (e.g., a
                redirect server) such as described in <xref target="bootstrap-server"/>,
                then credentials necessary to configure the bootstrap server would be
                provided to the prospective owner.  If the bootstrap server is
                configurable through an API (outside the scope of this document), then
                the credentials might be installed on the prospective owner's NMS so
                that the NMS can subsequently configure the manufacturer-hosted
                bootstrap server directly.</t>
              </list></t>
              <t>If the manufacturer's devices are able to validate signed data
              (<xref target="validating-signed-data"/>), and assuming that the
              prospective owner's NMS is able to prepare and sign the bootstrapping
              data itself, the prospective owner's NMS might set a trust anchor
              certificate onto the manufacturer's bootstrap server, using the
              credentials provided in the previous step.  This certificate is the
              trust anchor certificate that the prospective owner would like the
              manufacturer to place into the ownership vouchers it generates, thereby
              enabling devices to trust the owner's owner certificate.  How this trust
              anchor certificate is used to enable devices to validate signed bootstrapping
              data is described in <xref target="validating-signed-data"/>.</t>
              <t>Some time later, the prospective owner places an order
              with the manufacturer, perhaps with a special
              flag checked for SZTP handling.  At this time, or
              perhaps before placing the order, the owner may model
              the devices in their NMS, creating virtual objects for the
              devices with no real-world device associations.  For instance
              the model can be used to simulate the device's location in the
              network and the configuration it should have when fully
              operational.</t>
              <t>When the manufacturer fulfills the order, shipping
              the devices to their intended locations, they may notify the owner
              of the devices' serial numbers and shipping destinations, which
              the owner may use to stage the network for when the devices power
              on.  Additionally,  the manufacturer may send one or more ownership
              vouchers, cryptographically assigning ownership of those devices to
              the owner.  The owner may set this information on their NMS, perhaps
              binding specific modeled devices to the serial numbers and ownership
              vouchers.</t>

              more modeled devices.  That is, the owner tells the NMS to perform
              the steps necessary to prepare for when the real-world devices
              power up and initiate the bootstrapping process.  Note that,
              in some deployments, this step might be combined with the last step

              onboarding information.  That is, either the manufacturer hosted bootstrap
              server will redirect the device to another bootstrap server, or provide
              the device with the onboarding information itself.  The types of
              bootstrapping data the manufacturer hosted bootstrap server
              supports may vary by implementation; some implementations may only
              support redirect information, or only support onboarding information,

          <t>The interactions in the above diagram are described below.
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>Upon power being applied, the device checks to see if SZTP
              bootstrapping is configured, such as must be the case when running its
              "factory default" configuration.  If SZTP bootstrapping is
              not configured, then the bootstrapping logic exits and none of the
              following interactions occur.</t>
              <t>For each source of bootstrapping data the device supports, preferably
              in order of closeness to the device (e.g., removable storage before
              Internet based servers), the device checks to see if there is any
              bootstrapping data for it there.</t>
              <t>If onboarding information is found, the device initializes
              itself accordingly (e.g., installing a boot-image and committing an
              initial configuration).  If the source is a bootstrap server, and the
              bootstrap server can be trusted (i.e., TLS-level authentication), the
              device also sends progress reports to the bootstrap server.
                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>The contents of the initial configuration should configure
                  an administrator account on the device (e.g., username, SSH public
                  key, etc.), and should configure the device either to listen for
                  NETCONF or RESTCONF connections or to initiate call home connections
                  <xref target="RFC8071"/>, and should disable the SZTP
                  bootstrapping service (e.g., the "enabled" leaf in data model
                  presented in <xref target="device-model"/>).</t>
                  <t>If the bootstrap server supports forwarding device progress reports
                  to external systems (e.g., via a webhook), a "bootstrap-complete"
                  progress report (<xref target="yang-module"/>) informs the external
                  system to know when it can, for instance, initiate a connection to
                  the device.  To support this scenario further, the "bootstrap-complete"
                  progress report may also relay the device's SSH host keys and/or TLS
                  certificates, with which the external system can use to authenticate
                  subsequent connections to the device.</t>
                </list>
              If the device successfully completes the bootstrapping process,
              it exits the bootstrapping logic without considering any additional
              sources of bootstrapping data.
              </t>

              <t>Otherwise, if redirect information is found, the device iterates
              through the list of specified bootstrap servers, checking to see if
              the bootstrap server has bootstrapping data for the device.  If the bootstrap server
              returns more redirect information, then the device processes it recursively.
              Otherwise, if the bootstrap server returns onboarding information,
              the device processes it following the description provided in (3) above.</t>

              <t>After having tried all supported sources of bootstrapping data, the
              device may retry again all the sources and/or provide manageability
              interfaces for manual configuration (e.g., CLI, HTTP, NETCONF, etc.).
              If manual configuration is allowed, and such configuration is provided,
              the configuration should also disable the SZTP bootstrapping service,
              as the need for bootstrapping would no longer be present.</t>

              <t>Fixed "must" expressions, by converting "choice" to a "list" of
              "image-verification", each of which now points to a base identity
              called "hash-algorithm".  There's just one algorithm currently

              <t>The "redirect-information" container's "trust-anchor"

              for image verification reworked to be extensible.</t>
              <t>Added a reference to the "Device Details" section to
              the new example-device-data-model module.</t>
              <t>Clarified that the device must always pass its IDevID

              <t>Fixed the description statement for the "script" typedef
              to refer to the [pre/post]-script-[warning/error] enums,

              <t>For the get-bootstrapping-data RPC's input, removed
              the "remote-id" and "circuit-id" fields, and added a

              to be type "binary" instead of "anydata".</t>
              <t>Moved everything from PKCS#7 to CMS (this shows up
              as a big change).</t>
              <t>Added the early code point allocation assignments for the
              DHCP Options in the IANA Considerations section, and updated
              the RFC Editor note accordingly.</t>
              <t>Added RFC Editor request to replace the assigned values for

              send IDevID cert to device needing to always send authentication
              credentials, as this better matches what RFC 8040 Section 2.5 says.</t>

              <t>Rewrote section 5.6 (processing onboboarding information)
              to be clearer about error handling and retained state.
              Specifically:
                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>Clarified that a script, upon having an error, must
                     gracefully exit, cleaning up any state that might hinder
                     subsequent executions.</t>
                  <t>Added ability for scripts to be executed again with a
                     flag enabling them to clean up state from a previous
                     execution.</t>
                  <t>Clarified that the conifguration commit is atomic.</t>
                  <t>Clarified that any error encountered after committing the
                     configuration (e.g., in the "post-configuration-script")
                     must rollback the configuration to the previous
                     configuration.</t>
                  <t>Clarified that failure to successfully deliver the
                     "bootstrap-initiated" and "bootstrap-complete" progress
                     types must be treated as an error.</t>
                  <t>Clarified that "return to bootstrapping sequence" is to be
                     interpreted in the recursive context.  Meaning that the
                     device rolls-back one loop, rather than start over from
                     scratch.</t>
                </list>
              </t>
              <t>Changed how a device verifies a boot-image from just "MUST
                 match one of the supplied fingerprints" to also allow for
                 the verification to use an cryptographic signature embedded
                 into the image itself.</t>
              <t>Added more "progress-type" enums for visibility reasons, 
                 enabling more strongly-typed debug information to be sent
                 to the bootstrap server.</t>
              <t>Added Security Considerations based on early SecDir review.</t>
              <t>Added recommendation for device to send warning if the 
                 initial config does not disable the bootstrapping process.</t>
