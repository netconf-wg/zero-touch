This directory for the PKI for the owner's bootstrap server, that
is, for it's TLS server certificate.  This trusted certificate of
which goes into the <redirect-information> artifact.

While the removable storage device test does not (yet) establish
a TLS connection, and thus any base64 blob could be used, doing 
it this way is more reaslistic and underscores that the bootstrap
server's TLS certificate is distinctly different than the owner
certificate.
