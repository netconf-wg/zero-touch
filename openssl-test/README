The purpose of this test is to validate the "removable storage" solution
described in the draft from end-to-end using the OpenSSL library.

The removable storage solution is used an the test case only because it
if file based, which simplifies script development.

Highlights of the test includes:
  - generating a PKI for IDevID certificates
  - generating a PKI for Owner Certificates
  - generating a PKI for Ownership Vouchers
  - simulating an owner staging bootstrapping data onto a storage device
  - simulating a device processing the staged boostrapping data
     - when not asserting revocation status
     - when asserting revocation status
        - and nothing is revoked
        - and something is revoked
